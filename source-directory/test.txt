The Callback Pattern is a programming pattern used in asynchronous programming to manage the execution flow of code that depends on the completion of a specific task. Instead of waiting for a task to complete before proceeding, the callback pattern involves providing a function (the "callback") as an argument to another function that initiates the task. When the task is completed, the provided callback function is invoked. This pattern is commonly used in scenarios like event handling, timers, and network operations.
