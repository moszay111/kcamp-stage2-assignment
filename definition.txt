 Reactor Pattern: The Reactor Pattern is a design pattern used in software engineering, particularly in event-driven systems. It's often employed in scenarios where an application needs to handle a large number of potentially concurrent and asynchronous events, such as network communication or user interface interactions. In the Reactor Pattern, there's typically a central component called the "reactor" that manages and dispatches events to appropriate event handlers. The reactor itself monitors multiple event sources (such as network sockets) for any incoming events. When an event occurs, the reactor identifies the appropriate event handler to handle that event and delegates the event processing to that handler. This pattern helps to separate event dispatching and event handling concerns, making the codebase more maintainable and scalable.


 The Callback Pattern is a programming pattern used in asynchronous programming to manage the execution flow of code that depends on the completion of a specific task. Instead of waiting for a task to complete before proceeding, the callback pattern involves providing a function (the "callback") as an argument to another function that initiates the task. When the task is completed, the provided callback function is invoked. This pattern is commonly used in scenarios like event handling, timers, and network operations.

 The module system is a concept that involves organizing code into smaller, reusable, and logically separated units called "modules." These modules encapsulate related functionalities, data, or classes, allowing for better organization, code reusability, and maintainability.
